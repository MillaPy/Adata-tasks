# Adata-tasks
Task 1-3 are saved here:
- There is task 1  in sql form <br />
- Task 2 of python web scrapping code with results in excel file <br />
- Task 3 with test json and xml file (just for myself) <br />

=======

Task 1-3 are saved here. Made pull requests. Now there are no problems with new branches, so I approved them and merged together. 
Initially all code has been uploaded to 'tasks' branch, then merged into 'main'.
Therefore you can check up 'tasks' branch, yet in both branches content is similar.
